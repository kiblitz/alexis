synopsis:
  "a single-pass lexer library powered by regex deterministic finite automata"
description:
  "Alexis provides a functor for creating a lexer using regex-based rules. Lexers are usually the first phase of a compiler or interpreter where raw characters are converted into meaningful tokens. Unlike standard lexers that may backtrack, Alexis converts patterns into a DFA, allowing it to scan input in a single linear pass."
